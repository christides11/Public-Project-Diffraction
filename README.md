# Public-Project-Diffraction
The abandoned passion project of an unassuming baku

Note about project: All music has been removed from this public repository to prevent use without permission. 
I also advise caution in using any sound effect files in the project, as it consists of quite a few bought assets from the Unity Asset Store, some of which I later found out had stolen assets (iirc named Ultimate SFX bundle). 
Feel free to use all of the sprites, though. The baku wishes you the best in your creative endeavors.
